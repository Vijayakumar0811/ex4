    Velachery Lake, located in Chennai, is a vital waterbody that helps manage monsoon runoff and supports groundwater recharge. Over the years, rapid urbanization has led to significant encroachment, reducing its original size from 265 acres to just 55 acres. Efforts have been proposed to restore and beautify the lake, including fencing, walking decks, and plantation projects.
